# Reading the Docs.

The `Buffer` class is a subclass of `Uint8Array` class, which is a TypedArray introduced in ES6. Therefore, it would be good to understand the concept of TypedArrays to dive deeper into the `Buffer` class. However, before we can understand the concept of TypedArrays, we must understand the concept of binary numbers and their operators in depth.

We do not cover TypedArrays or binary numbers further in this course, but dropping these details here for future referencing.
