# Introduction.

Binary data is the only category of data that can be directly understood and executed by a computer. It is numerically represented by a combination of zeros and ones. Everything on our computers - files, network requests, operating system, sounds, videos, etc - is binary data.

We have many different ways to represent these zeros and ones. For example, CPUs within our computers use transistors to represent these zeros and ones. Apple M1 has 16 billion transistors, and each of these transistors can represent an 'off' switch (zero) and an 'on' switch (one).

Buffers in Node JS help us deal with these zeros and ones; they connect Node JS to these zeros and ones. Without buffers, Node JS cannot work with network requests, database connections, and everything else we need to build network applications.

Before dealing with buffers in Node JS, we need to understand three fundamental computer science concepts: binary numbers, hexadecimal numbers, and character encoding.
